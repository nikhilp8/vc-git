What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git file is created in the directory. Unless a .git file is present, git cannot
create new commits in the directory.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	When working on a project, when people add different features to the code, we have to add the
changes to the original code. So adding branches helps in updating the master code and saving lot of time.
Diagramatic representation is very helpful when trying to understand the concept. It also gives us an idea
of changes we make.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	automatic merging is good when there is no ambuiguity in code of the branches i.e when particular
function or entity is different in both of the branches. If this is not the case it can merge the code
automatically. As mentioned manual merging comes into effect for the above case. It is always good to
do it manually in this case as the developer will have a good idea about it.
